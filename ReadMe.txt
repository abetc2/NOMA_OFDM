Description
In this code one communication user and multiple sensing users send
their signals in the same frequency band. The algorithm used in this
code allows to separate signals at the receiver. For details you can
the paper "CSI-based Sensing with NOMA of Multiple Sensing Users for
ISAC". Also you can reach the paper from the following link:

Abbreviations
SU used for sensing user, CU used for communication user

Analyzed Conditions
Only ISAC-ICE is indicated in this code for the condition 1,2,3,4
SUs. For CO-ISAC you can add just simple orthogonal condition without
using the proposed algorithm.
